# Similar-Question-Finder Architecture

This document presents the formal architecture for the Similar-Question-Finder application. The application is designed to help students expand their knowledge by finding 10 different questions similar to their own, using advanced language processing and vector similarity search techniques.

## 1. Frontend

- Framework: React, Angular, or Vue.js
- Purpose: Build a responsive and interactive web application to provide a user-friendly interface for students to enter their questions

## 2. Backend/API

- Framework: Flask (Python)
- Purpose: Develop a RESTful API to accept questions from the frontend, process them, and return 10 similar questions, enabling separation of concerns and better scalability and maintainability

## 3. Natural Language Processing (NLP)

- Library: Hugging Face Transformers or SpaCy
- Model: Pre-trained models like BERT or GPT
- Purpose: Leverage state-of-the-art NLP techniques to process the input question and convert it into a vector representation for efficient similarity search

## 4. Vector Similarity Search

- Database: Weaviate
- Purpose: Utilize Weaviate, a RESTful vector database, to store and manage the vector representations of questions and enable efficient similarity search for rapid retrieval of the most similar questions

## 5. General Database

- Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, or Amazon DynamoDB
- Purpose: Store other application-related data that does not require vector similarity search in a robust and scalable database for quick retrieval

## 6. Caching

- Service: Redis or Memcached
- Purpose: Implement caching mechanisms to store the results of recent queries, reducing the load on NLP and vector similarity search components and improving response times for users

## 7. Deployment

- Platform: Amazon Web Services (AWS)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform
- Deployment Services: AWS Elastic Beanstalk or AWS Lambda
- Purpose: Deploy and scale the application in a reliable and efficient manner on a leading cloud platform, utilizing Terraform to manage the infrastructure consistently and reproducibly

By following this architecture, the Similar-Question-Finder application will be built on a robust, scalable, and maintainable foundation that leverages modern NLP techniques and vector similarity search with Weaviate to provide a valuable service to its users.
